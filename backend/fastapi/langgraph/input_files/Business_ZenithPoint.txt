The Zenith Point Wellness Collective


Nestled in a vibrant corner of Southeast Portland, The Zenith Point Wellness Collective offers a sanctuary for holistic healing and rejuvenation. For the past eight years, Zenith Point has provided a tranquil space for Licensed Massage Therapists (LMTs) and Acupuncture Therapists to practice their craft and serve the local community.


The Collective operates out of a charming, renovated two-story building. The ground floor features a welcoming reception area and three private treatment rooms equipped with massage tables, linens, and ambient lighting. The second floor houses four additional treatment rooms (some with acupuncture supplies like needles and moxa), a small administrative office, and a shared break room for the practitioners.


While the LMTs and Acupuncture Therapists are independent contractors who cultivate their own client base, The Zenith Point Wellness Collective handles several crucial administrative functions. This includes managing the facility, providing scheduling software accessible to both practitioners and clients, processing payments (including direct billing to insurance companies), and managing the overall business operations. The Collective has a part-time administrative assistant who manages the front desk, handles scheduling inquiries, and assists with billing. The owner, a sole proprietor, oversees the entire operation.


Zenith Point's revenue comes from a percentage of the fees collected from clients by the practitioners. They utilize online scheduling software that integrates with their billing system. They also maintain a basic website with practitioner bios, service descriptions, and contact information. Communication with practitioners primarily occurs through email and a shared online platform. Patient information, including treatment notes and insurance details, is stored digitally.


The Collective relies on standard office equipment, including a front desk computer, a server located in the office for local data storage, a printer/scanner, and a secure Wi-Fi network for staff and practitioners. They utilize cloud-based services for their website and potentially some aspects of their billing software.
