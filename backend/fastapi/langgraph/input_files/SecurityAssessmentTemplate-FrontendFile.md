1. **Establish reasons for performing a security assessment to align deliverables with expectations**

   1.  Discuss what is in scope or not in scope to be included in the assessment as well as addressing why the assessment was requested in the first place.  

   2.  Ensure the resulting document includes actionable items that are applicable to the organization and are prioritized with metrics to support.

   3.  Set up future objective/meeting dates, timelines and offer a formal conclusion to the assessment

2. **Develop a profile of the organization**

   1.  Establish a current profile of the organization, including a list of assets

   2.  Understand existing remediations for people, processes and technology

   3. Measure the overall maturity as a starting point (NIST)
           
   4. Ask questions to get details under the following categories, working towards identifying all assets or operations and possible remediations already in place.  This list uses the CIS guide, can be expanded, but also should include questions related to the NIST measurements (you will need to uncover and understand their assets and previous efforts to both measure and then create a risk matrix).  Here are the top categories:


3. **Create Target profile of organization**

   1.  Using industry standards, develop a reasonable target profile

   2.  Using MITRE Attack options, understand where vulnerabilities exist

4. **Identify Gaps between current and target profiles**

5. **Create Risk matrix:  for each Asset, the Risk \= Likelihood (of a vulnerability being exploited) x Impact (depth and breadth).  So items that are very important to the business (impact) or extremely likely to occur (phishing) should rise to the top of the matrix.**

6. **Rank gaps by risk ranking for each asset, remaining vulnerability and remediation**

7. **Using Risk matrix, identify improvements and rank them using agreed upon metrics**

   1.  Action

   2. Priority

8. **Measure final maturity (NIST) as a target**

9. **Deliver Security Assessment report to client and discuss.  Report should include all of these sections, reiterate the goals of conducting the assessment, remind them this is meant to be repeated after some period of time, and in the end they should have a much better understanding of where to allocate resources if they want to lower their information security risk profile.**
