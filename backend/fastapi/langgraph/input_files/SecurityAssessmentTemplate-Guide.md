1. # **Establish reasons for performing a security assessment to align deliverables with expectations**

   1. ## Discuss what is in scope or not in scope to be included in the assessment as well as addressing why the assessment was requested in the first place.  

   2. ## Ensure the resulting document includes actionable items that are applicable to the organization and are prioritized with metrics to support.

   3. ## Set up future objective/meeting dates, timelines and offer a formal conclusion to the assessment

2. # **Develop a profile of the organization**

   1. ## Establish a current profile of the organization, including a list of assets

   3. ## Measure the overall maturity as a starting point (NIST)

      1. ### Identify

         1. #### Asset management \- inventory of devices, software, communication workflows, external information systems documented and inventoried

         2. #### Business Environment \- established and documented supply chains, dependencies, delivery requirements and conditions to exist as a business

         3. #### Governance \- documentation of security policies, roles, responsibilities, legal and regulatory requirements, and how well that is all understood

         4. #### Risk Assessment \- are risks identified, vulnerabilities, threat intelligence and such and how are they prioritized within the organization

         5. #### Risk Management Strategy \- To what extent are risk management decisions established, managed, and agreed to by key stakeholders? How well is the organization’s risk tolerance clearly expressed and understood by leadership? To what extent is risk tolerance informed by the organization’s role in the business ecosystem and sector-specific risks?

         6. #### Supply Chain Risk Management \- To what extent are vendor management processes established and managed, third parties identified and assessed using those risk management processes, and contracts with third parties used to implement measures to maintain cybersecurity posture?

      2. ### Protect

         1. #### Identity Management and Access Control \- To what extent are identities and credentials managed for authorized devices and users, physical access to assets managed and protected, remote access managed, access permissions and authorizations managed to incorporate principles of least privilege and separation of duties? To what extent is network integrity protected, identities proofed and bound to credentials and asserted in interactions, and users and devices authenticated measured against the risk of the transaction within the organization?

         2. #### Awareness and Training \- To what extent are all users informed and trained? Do privileged users/third-party stakeholders/senior executives/physical and cybersecurity personnel understand their roles and responsibilities within the organization?

         3. #### Data Security \- To what extent are data-at-rest and data-in-transit protected and assets formally managed throughout the organization's removal/transfers/disposition? To what extent is adequate capacity available, protections against data leaks implemented, integrity mechanisms implemented, development and testing environments kept separate from production environments, and integrity checking mechanisms used to verify hardware integrity (as available) within the organization?

         4. #### Information Protection (processes and procedures) \- To what extent is a baseline configuration created and maintained incorporating security principles, a Systems Development Lifecycle implemented, configuration change control processes in place, backups conducted and maintained, policies and regulations met? To what extent are protection processes improved and effectiveness measured, response plans in place and regularly tested, vulnerability management plans developed and implemented, and cybersecurity programs included in human resources practices within the organization?

         5. #### Maintenance \- To what extent are maintenance and repair of organizational assets performed and logged with approved and controlled tools, as well as remote maintenance of organizational assets approved and performed in a manner that prevents unauthorized access within the organization?

         6. #### Protective Technology \- To what extent are audit logs documented and reviewed, removable media protected and use restricted as necessary, communications and control networks protected, and mechanisms implemented to achieve resilience requirements in most organizational situations?

      3. ### Detect

         1. #### Anomalies and Events \- To what extent are a baseline of network operations and expected data flows for users and systems established and managed within the organization? To what extent are detected events analyzed to understand attack targets and methods, data collected and correlated from multiple sources, the impact of events determined, and incident alert thresholds established within the organization?

         2. #### Security and Continuous Monitoring \- To what extent is the digital and physical environment monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events, malicious code detected, external service provider activity monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events, and monitoring for unauthorized access and vulnerability scans performed within the organization?

         3. #### Detection Processes \- To what extent are detection roles and responsibilities well defined to ensure accountability, detection activities comply with all applicable requirements, detection processes are tested and continuously improved, and event detection information is communicated within the organization?

         3. #### Communications \- To what extent are public relations managed and reputation repaired after a cyber incident, and are recovery activities communicated to internal and external stakeholders and executive management teams within the organization?

   4. ## Ask questions to get details under the following categories, working towards identifying all assets or operations and possible remediations already in place.  This list uses the CIS guide, can be expanded, but also should include questions related to the NIST measurements (you will need to uncover and understand their assets and previous efforts to both measure and then create a risk matrix).  Here are the top categories:

      1. ### Infosec policy

      2. ### Human resource security

      3. ### Asset management

      4. ### Organization of information security

      5. ### Access control

      6. ### Cryptography

      7. ### Risk management

      8. ### Communications security

      9. ### Physical and environmental security

      10. ### Operations security

      11. ### Supplier relationships

      12. ### Compliance

      13. ### Acquisition, development

      14. ### Incident management

      15. ### Business continuity

3. # **Create Target profile of organization**

   1. ## Using industry standards, develop a reasonable target profile

   2. ## Using MITRE Attack options, understand where vulnerabilities exist

4. # **Identify Gaps between current and target profiles**

5. # **Create Risk matrix:  for each Asset, the Risk \= Likelihood (of a vulnerability being exploited) x Impact (depth and breadth).  So items that are very important to the business (impact) or extremely likely to occur (phishing) should rise to the top of the matrix.**

6. # **Rank gaps by risk ranking for each asset, remaining vulnerability and remediation**

7. # **Using Risk matrix, identify improvements and rank them using agreed upon metrics**

   1. ## Action

   2. ## Priority

      1. ### Owner

      2. ### Deadline

      3. ### Resources

8. # **Measure final maturity (NIST) as a target**

9. # **Deliver Security Assessment report to client and discuss.  Report should include all of these sections, reiterate the goals of conducting the assessment, remind them this is meant to be repeated after some period of time, and in the end they should have a much better understanding of where to allocate resources if they want to lower their information security risk profile.**
