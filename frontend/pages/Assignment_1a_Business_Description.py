            1. Take a look at the **business description, location, activities, and assets**. 
            2. Once you have a good idea of what the business does and what assets they have, **prepare a list of questions you have regarding their security practices**.
            3. When your list is ready, **go to the business owner and start the chat.** (*Note: They can only meet you a few times! Being a founder is difficult!*)
            4. **Ask the business owner the questions you prepared** for them, and *take notes* of their answers. (*Note: They are non-technical, so you will need to do some interpretation!*)
            5. Once you have the answers to your questions, you are ready to move to the next stage of this project!
